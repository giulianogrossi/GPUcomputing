It requires no setup and runs entirely in the **cloud**. In Google Colab you can write, execute, save and share your Jupiter Notebooks. You access powerful computing resources like **TPUs** and **GPUs** all for free through your browser. All major Python libraries like **Tensorflow**, **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **Pandas**, etc. are pre-installed. Google Colab requires no configuration, you only need a **Google Account** and then you are good to go. Your notebooks are stored in your **Google Drive**, or can be loaded from **GitHub**. Colab notebooks can be shared just as you would with Google Docs or Sheets.
